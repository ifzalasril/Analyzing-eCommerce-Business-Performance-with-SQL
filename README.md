This Mini-Project is Part of Rakamin Academy's Data Science Bootcamp

# Description
I play the role of a member of the data analysis team in an e-commerce company.
This company is one of the largest marketplaces in South America that connects micro-businesses with their customers.
As a member of the Data Analytics team, I am responsible for analysing three aspects of the company's business performance.
These three aspects are customer growth, product quality and payment methods.
I will process the data provided to produce a business performance report on these three aspects.
