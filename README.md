# Description
I play the role of a member of the Data Analytics team at an eCommerce company.
This company is one of the largest marketplaces in South America that connects micro-businesses with their customers.
As a member of the Data Analytics team, I am responsible for analyzing three aspects related to the company's business performance.
These three aspects include customer growth, product quality, and payment types.
I will process the data that has been provided to create a business performance report on these three aspects.
